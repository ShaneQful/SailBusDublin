SailBus Dublin
==============

Real Time Information App for Dublin bus for the Sailfish Operating System on the new Jolla smartphones.

#### Architecture:

* RTPI API
* Sinatra Server (Ruby)
* Local Dublin Bus API (JS)
* Application State Object (JS)
* Graphical Layer (QML)

#### Note for anyone who wants to contribute:

* Use the Google Style Guide for JS
* If you change the JS make it JSLint compliant:
	* You can have the messy whitespace flag enabled but be reasonable i.e. tabbing must make sense and use 4 spaces instead of tabs
	* You should also have the browser flag enabled (may add directives in for this)
* Once there is unit tests run them and make sure they pass before making a pull request
